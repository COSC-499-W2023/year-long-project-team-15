I have completed some React intro courses and watched some videos. I completed the database ER diagram and watched some videos on graphQL to translate the diagram to a graphGL schema and integrated it into amplify studio so it could use the data model to build some react components.

**Tasks**

![wills week 8 tasks](./screenshots/wills_tasks_week8.png)

This week myself and the team spent alot of time trying to get a lambda trigger to update our database after a user signs up with aws cognito services. So far sign up with verification and sign in forms display properly  and are functional and users can sign out, however lambda function is not updating the database. 

**In Progress**

For this week and future weeks up to the next milestone, my goals are to integrate  UI elements into our app with functionality and work on the design document and demo vid.

**Tasks**

![wills week 12 tasks](./screenshots/wills_tasks_week12.png)

## Week 13

Goals:

For this week my goals are to finish integrating UI elements into our app with functionality that I started on and complete the design document and demo vid with Mac.

**Tasks**

![wills week 13 tasks](./screenshots/wills_tasks_week13.png)

This week I created functional react components for the main communication panel page of our app such as a header and the sidebar to view contacts. I set up the routing of our app to have a main page and an account page. Doing so I had to refactor some components. The header does the page routing and the side bar shows the users friends list and can search friends by string pattern. I also fixed some design layout/sizing issues with the UI and set up our cypress testing pipline with Mac. Mac and I also completed the design doc and demo vid for this design milestone.

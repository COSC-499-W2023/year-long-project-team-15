Completed tasks 1-4. I am not including a screenshot of completed tasks as only task 5 is on project board and was not done.

I have completed some React intro courses and watched some videos. I completed the database ER diagram and watched some videos on graphQL to translate the diagram to a graphGL schema and integrated it into amplify studio so it could use the data model to build some react components.

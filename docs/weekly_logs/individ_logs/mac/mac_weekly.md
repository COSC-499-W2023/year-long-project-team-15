This week we just worked together to come up with the project plan. We all contributed our input to decide on our tech stack, milestones and overall functionality goals and features for our project. I helped write the project plan document and contributed my input in our discussions where applicable. No coding tasks this week.

Goals: 
- created github project board for tasks to be completed for the entire project
- assign tasks to miles stones
- assign this milestones tasks to group members
- set up aws account
- connect repo to aws amplify for ci/cd

Completed goals 1-4. We had some trouble accessing AWS services and I had to email Scott Mcmillan to get it sorted out. Our account ended up being set to the wrong region and when we switched the problems were resolved. No coding tasks started for me this week. Learning react by doing an online course.

Goals:
- Get amplify working on aws
- Start learning react 

This week I completed my goals. We worked with Bowen to fix a problem with giving AWS access to our github repo. I started learning react as it is what we chose to use for our frontend framework. I bought an online course and I'm working through it. Still no actual coding tasks for me, hoping to start coding next week and work on the login page!

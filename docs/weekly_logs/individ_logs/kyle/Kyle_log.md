## General Notes
Me and Saksham did pair programming this week to get the account page and friend list functionalites working and succesfully merged with each other so
that they were operational for the heuristic evaulations next week. We merged together a few branches this week that have been seperate for awhile so
we managed to fix the merge conflicts and get a MVP ready. Currently wrting a set of heuristics for peer evaluations next week.

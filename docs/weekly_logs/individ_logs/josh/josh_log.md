## Tasks Completed 
* Setup AWS Ampifily 
* Learn React.JS Basics (For the most part, need to look a bit more into routing / escape hatches / useContext hook)
* install NPM for create-react-app and other dependencies  

For AWS amplifly there was a few issues when setting up with our repo and with certian permissions. We were able to get it set up and however we were having issues setting up AWS amplifly CLI. reverted to studio, then was able to do CLI init commands for amplify. Messed around with the interface, got a littler more familar with it on Saturday with Will and Mac.

Learned basic React.JS concepts, however need to go more into state-management (Ways to pass props besides prop-drilling, useContext, useReference, etc.)

For The UI, I created a few basic Frames, I.E Hero page, login/signup, 
communication dashboard. However, Amplify has a pre-built figma-to-react SYNC as long as you use their figma UI Kit. So im re-doing the UI in this KIT instead so we can auto-generate components react components, then code the state management / buisness logic. 

## Goals for next week
* Finish Amplifiy UI KIT Design Layout 
* Sync Figma to React Components, start working with generated components
* Integrate pre-made auth components for a basic login / sign up page 
* Look into testing for AWS components like Authenticator (cypress, selenium, or some aws-specific testing framework?)

For the last two weeks, we have been struggling with setting up Authenticator / the AWS congito intergration. We need to create a Post Auth Confirmation Lambda trigger to create a user entry. Had bugs we couldn't figure out on last thursday (26th). I Haven't been able to put much work into the project for the last two weeks due to midterms and a paper. We will make sure we have everything ready by thursday but Im not sure if we are going to be able to create testing for the presentation.

## Goals for next week
* Integrate pre-made auth components for a basic login / sign up page 
* Work on Figma design for Design milestone
* Complete Sign in / Sign up auth + post confirmation lamba function working.

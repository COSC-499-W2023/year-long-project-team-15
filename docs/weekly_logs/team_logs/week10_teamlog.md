## Week 10 (Nov 5th - Nov 12th) 

This week, we did not complete much in terms of the project. We did a little bit of project planning and generally talked about who would like to 
work on either the Account Settings or the Communication Panel. We discussed testing for our Authentication flow as well.

Next week, we will get another dev env setup through Amplify for the authentication and then create some of the component, and some routing for the two main pages.

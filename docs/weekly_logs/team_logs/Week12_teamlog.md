## Weekly Context
This week we are mostly concerned with the upcoming video-presentation and making sure we have our presentable project features updated. We
are also working on figuring out configuring AWS cognito with GraphQL/DynamoDB.

Next week, We will continue to polish our presentation components and continue looking into React concepts, Database functionality and continue working on other UI components.

#### This week interactive UI features and features such as the proifle picture in the header were added. The only major extra feature we are working on implementing is capturing live picture which user can click from their device and share in chat. Now that all of our major features are impleneted we'll be spending our time fixing small bugs and making sure everything works smoothly and all the styling is up to standard.

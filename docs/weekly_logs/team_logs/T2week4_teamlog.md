## Weekly Context
Super productive week. Got bugs fixed and accomplished all of our goals. Photo blurring piepline is up and finctional, video blurring will work the same way so frontend logic is ready for that implmentation. Adding contacts working aswell. Will also fixed the header and moved the logout button and account button into a dropdown from the profile page. Saksham also started to implement profile pictures. Looking forward to getting shared files working and setting up video blurring on AWS. All tests done manually this week.

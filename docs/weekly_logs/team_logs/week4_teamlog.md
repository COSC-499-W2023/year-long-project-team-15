## Week 4 (Sep 24th - Oct 1st) 

### For this week, we voided the burnup chart / task board due to the project planning, no github work was done

This week, we focused most of our attention to the project proposal and project plan. 
During class on thursday, we dicussed how the UI of the software could look like and tried 
visualization our user scenarios. This helped in our process of breaking down some of the features 
however some of our milestone features are still generalized.  

Next week, we will begin setting up our repo so that we can translate our proposal onto our project board, as well 
as beginning to learn the AWS and other JS softwares we will need to use for our project.

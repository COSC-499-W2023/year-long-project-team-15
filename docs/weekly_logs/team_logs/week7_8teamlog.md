## In week 7,  we continued our React.JS learning process, set up Amplifly Studio, discussed DB Design 

Goals for Week 7: 
- Database setup/exploring GraphQL
- Setup AWS with github repo
- Continue learning react 
- Integrate Amplify Studio, begin working on Auth / DB Design

This week, we worked on getting familar with the Amplify Studio Interface. It took some time to integrate the Amplify in CLI with our user accounts as we were having issues with using CLI commands and accessKeys, so we ended up using the UI interface instead (Studio) to set up our repo. After doing this, we were able to use amplify CLI setup commands to configure database options. Will worked on a DB Design for our project. Josh is refactoring the UI to an Amplify Specifc Kit in Figma that will allow to use to generate React Components
 

There are a few more React Concepts we need to learn, I.E. routing, more fine-tune state management, and others, however we will begin creating the general app skeleton, then work towards these features in the future.

## In week 8, We will finalize our notes and notable features for mini-presentation next week

Goals for Week 8: 
- Create presentation report for currently implemented features.
- Contiue working on user authentication flow
- Create a lambda function for AWS cognito user pools
- Finalize design for rest of UI



Completed tasks these weeks:
- DB Design
- Amplifiy Studio / Full Repo Integration

## Weekly Context
This week we are mostly concerned with the upcoming mini-presentation and making sure we have our presentable project features updated. We
are also working on figuring out configuring AWS cognito with GraphQL/DynamoDB.

Next week, We will continue to polish our presentaion components and continue looking into React concepts, Database functionality and continue working on other UI components.

## Weekly Context
This week we had a productive look at our project and final features for the upcoming second peer test. Heading into the week long reading break we will implement a chat conversation feature to add to the video
uploading that we have already added to the chat window. Also working on being able to delete friends and work on the MUI design to make the app more user friendly. Still have a good number of bugs to fix but feeling good about our progress before the break.
